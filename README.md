# MediaAugmentor

This readme is currently just for myself so I can talk about all the ways I'm going to go about this program. 

<br>

The point of this program is that it's going to take in a media file of some type (gif, mp4, etc.) and generate frames 
between frames and double the frame rate.

<br>

using opencv to read and analyze the images and we'll work from there.
